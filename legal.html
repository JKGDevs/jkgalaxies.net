            <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
            <p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with possibly personally
                identifiable
                information, including but not limited to IP address, operating system, or browser. The information is
                typically
                requested automatically via javascript, and you can prevent this information from being diclosed by properly
                configuring your web browser and using services such as a VPN or web proxy. The information that we request
                is
                intended to be non-identifiable when possible, and used as described in this privacy policy.

            <p>
                The webpage uses third party services that may collect information used to identify you. For example services 
                we use include use
                of Github's API (which primarily provides statistical data about files downloaded, such as which OS build
                you are
                downloading) and a Discord bot (which is used for forwarding news announcements to this page, but may
                collect
                information about your browser). See below for more details about data collection from third party services.
            </p>
    
            <p><strong>IP Address Data</strong></p>
            <p>As we do not run ads, it is not in our interest to know who you are and follow you around the internet. We
                store your
                ip address and web browser to help prevent abuse of services and identify visitors as being unique. The
                Services may
                use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors
                to our
                Site, the number of downloads users have made, as well as the sites which refer visitors to Jedi Knight
                Galaxies. We
                don't use it for tracking you, nor are we interested in knowing what your online activities may be.

            <p>We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your personal information.

                to help make our services (such as this website) possible based on a combination of their reputation, usability and commitment to privacy
