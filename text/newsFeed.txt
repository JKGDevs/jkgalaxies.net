Welcome to the new site!  A new test release for Jedi Knight Galaxies is available for v1.3.21.  Check the bottom of the <a href="https://www.jkgalaxies.net/download.html#testdiv">downloads page</a> to get the test release.  Futuza is busy getting a few new features, balance changes and bug fixes ready for the next patch.  Shout out to Xycaleth for helping me fix some debugger issues and making development way easier.  Hope to see you in game soon!
