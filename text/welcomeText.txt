Either by luck, or wisdom, you've arrived at the website of the biggest, most extensive and evolving mod ever made for a Star Wars game. Welcome to choices, welcome to adventures! Welcome; to Jedi Knight Galaxies, a free modification for Ravensoft’s Q3-based game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight:_Jedi_Academy">Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a>.<br><br>With new models, animations, maps, music, and naturally including an all new exciting plotline, all backed up by extreme amounts of coding. As far as a total conversion goes, we prefer to call JKG a game, more than a mod.  Except for the fact that we want to bring you all this, completely free of charge!<br><br>
Welcome to Jedi Knight Galaxies, where we break the limits!
