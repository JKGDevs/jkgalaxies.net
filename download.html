        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p><strong>What are binaries and assets?</strong><br>
            The binaries are the executable code of the game and the most frequently updated, it contains the game's
            logic and instructions. The assets contain the game's artwork, models, music, data, etc. Both are required
            to play.
        </p>

        <p><strong>I notice there is a primary release and a test release, which install do I want?</strong><br>
            Most players will want to install the <a href="#testdiv" title="Jump to test releases on page." alt="Link to test releases on this page.">test release located at the bottom of the page</a> 
            as this will have the latest bug fixes and newest features and is updated the most often.  Just keep in mind 
            this is also usually the buggiest and most likely to crash.  If you want a slightly more stable client, get 
            the primary release instead.  Most servers run the latest test release.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Is Jedi Academy required to play?</strong><br>
            <a href="faq.html#FAQJA2Play" title="Click link for more info." alt="Click link for more info.">Jedi Academy</a> must be installed first
            before you can play.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Which linux distributions are available?</strong><br>
            A debian based distribution compiled for ubuntu is available. You may also <a
                href="https://github.com/JKGDevs/JediKnightGalaxies" alt="Link to Github." target="_blank">build the source code yourself</a> to run it on
            distributions not provided here.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Is macOS available?</strong><br>
            A build for macOS Catalina (10.15) is available here, but is not supported.  The game should compile for newer versions of macOS if you wish to <a
            href="https://github.com/JKGDevs/JediKnightGalaxies" alt="Link to Github." target="_blank">build the source code yourself</a>.  
        </p>

        <p><strong>Do I need the map packs?</strong><br>
            The default game comes with only one map, it is highly recommended you install the map packs as well, however
            you can still technically play with only one map. Most JKG servers use several maps and you will need them
            installed to play on these servers.  Additional maps also provide a much richer experience, and you'll make
            our level designers sad if you don't try them all out!
        </p>

        <p><strong>My antivirus says JKG is a virus. Is it?</strong><br>
            No. Because Jedi Knight Galaxies is frequently updated, some antivirus vendors may flag it as suspicious. We
            try to expose new releases to several antivirus vendors shortly after release to help mitigate this, but
            some vendors are paranoid and notorious for incorrectly identifying legitimate software for malware. If you
            would like a 2nd opinion, feel free to upload it to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com" alt="Link to virustotal.com" target="_blank">Virus Total</a> to
            have it scanned by major antivirus vendors.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Where can I get more information about the game?</strong><br>

        <br id="Instructions">
        <br>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>After ensuring Jedi Academy is installed, and downloading the binaries and assets for your operating system
            you are ready to install. These instructions are also available in the readme provided with each release.
        </p>
        <p>First, navigate to your Jedi Academy install's GameData folder. The GameData
            folder is typically in the following location if you have Steam: 'SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Jedi
            Academy\GameData'. Other types of installs will have a similar location. </p>
        <p>Then from the downloaded zip binary, drag and drop the jkgalaxies directory (the one the readme is alongside) into
            Jedi Academy's GameData folder.
            If you have a previous installation of JKG, just replace the jkgalaxies directory with the one in the zip (if you
            have a really old version of JKG, you'll likely want to just install from scratch). Your directory structure should
            look like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3enIJaU.png" target="_blank">this</a> when installed:
        </p>
        <pre id="directoryText">[Loading...]</pre>

        <p>Now that you have created the jkgalaxies folder and placed the binaries inside, you will need to add the
            assets as well. Unzip the contents of the assets zip downloaded and copy the contents (everything inside the
            folder that contains the readme) into the JKG folder located inside the jkgalaxies folder.</p>

        <h3>Launching the Game</h3>
        <p>On Windows:<br>
            In order to play the game, use the 'Run JKGalaxies.bat' file (which lies in jkgalaxies) by double clicking
            it. If your game starts <a href="https://i.imgur.com/F81Too9.png "
                title="Click link to see what this error looks like." alt="Link to error picture." target="_blank">without a blue cursor</a> you most likely
            installed it wrong (the game is not seeing the Gamedata directory for JKA), you can also edit the batch file
            if you'd prefer to install it elsewhere from the directions above (but you're on your own if you do!).</p>

        <p>On Linux:<br>
            In order to play the game, use the 'runjkg.sh' script in the terminal.<br>
            You will need to make sure you have the necessary dependencies (SDL, libpng, ...) to run the game.
        </p>
