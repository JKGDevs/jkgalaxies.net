Welcome to choices, welcome to adventures!  Jedi Knight Galaxies is a competitive and innovative multiplayer shooter, played out in the Star Wars universe. Currently a full conversion mod, the project was originally based on and modified from <a href="https://www.ravensoftware.com" alt="Link to Ravensoftware." title="Ravensoft's webpage.">Ravensoft’s</a> Q3-based game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight:_Jedi_Academy" alt="Link to JKA Wikipedia page." title="Link to JKA Wikipedia page.">Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a>.<br><br>
Jedi Knight Galaxies is open source and available completely free of charge; however, you will need the original game in order to play. We aim to develop the project into a Large Multiplayer Online game, crossing traditional RPG (role playing game) elements with the fast paced excitement of an FPS (first person shooter).  The game is a much loved hobby project supported by its community and developers who work on it in their freetime, contribution is encouraged and newbies are welcome.<br><br>
Welcome to Jedi Knight Galaxies, where we break the limits!
