        <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
        <p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with possibly personally
            identifiable
            information, including but not limited to IP address, operating system, or browser. The information is
            typically
            requested automatically via javascript, and you can prevent this information from being diclosed by properly
            configuring your web browser and using services such as a VPN or web proxy. The information that we request
            is
            intended to be non-identifiable when possible, and used as described in this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The webpage uses third party services that may collect information used to identify you. Services we use
            include use
            of Github's API (which primarily provides statistical data about files downloaded, such as which OS build
            you are
            downloading) and a Discord bot (which is used for forwarding news announcements to this page, but may
            collect
            information about your browser). See below for more details.
        </p>

        <p><strong>IP Address Data</strong></p>
        <p>As we do not run ads, it is not in our interest to know who you are and follow you around the internet. We
            store your
            ip address and web browser to help prevent abuse of services and identify visitors as being unique. The
            Services may
            use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors
            to our
            Site, the number of downloads users have made, as well as the sites which refer visitors to Jedi Knight
            Galaxies. We
            don't use it for tracking you, nor are we interested in knowing what your online activities may be.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3rd Party Services</strong></p>

            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your personal information.
            The reason
            is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use
            the
            information for any other purpose. We consider them to be reliable and have chosen to use them based on
            their
            reputation, usability and commitment to privacy and security.
